# Turtle-Crossing-Game

This is a "Turtle Crossing Game" that i've created using python. 

The game starts off with a turtle in the bottom of the screen and all the player has to do is make sure the turtle reaches the other end of the screen by controlling the up arrow key.
Now, ofcourse there comes to obstructions. The turtle has to reach the other end without clashing the moving cars on its way.

Everytime the turtle successfully reaches the other end of the screen, the scoreboard level keeps increasing and with every increase in the levels, the speed of the moving cars keep increasing.

And, when turtle clashes with any car, its "Game Over" and the game stops then and there.
